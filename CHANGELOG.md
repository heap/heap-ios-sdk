## [8.2.0] - 2022-04-05

### Added
- Added options to disable various title, ivar, and accessibility label capture with the `disableTitleCapture`, `disableIvarCapture`,

- Improved logging of React Native events in the console.
- Added support for React Native in Event Visualizer.

### Fixed

  issue is detected, but it can also be manually enabled with the `useFastEVScreenshotCapture` property on `HeapOptions`.

- Improved capture of view controller titles.
- Fixed infinite recursion crash in SwiftUI previews.
- Resolved `(null)` pageview properties.

## [4.0.1] -- unreleased
### Added
- Include this changelog in the package on CocoaPods

## [4.0.0] - 2017-03-08
### Added
- Improved library documentation.
- Annotated methods to improve usability from Swift.
- Allow hiding views from Heap by adding a boolean user defined attribute
  called `heapIgnore` in Interface Builder and setting it to true.

### Fixed
- Changed view controller capture to more accurately represent the current
  view.

### Deprecated
These methods were already deprecated in 3.0.0, but we're highlighting
them here as we intend to remove them in a future release.

- The `identifyDeprecated:` method is (obviously) deprecated, and should
  be replaced by `identify:`. See [user identities and properties
  documentation][id] for the correct usage.
- The `setEventProperties:` and `unsetEventProperty:` methods are
  deprecated, and should be replaced by `addEventProperties:` and
  `removeEventProperty:` respectively. The new methods are aliases, so
  simply replacing calls will work.
